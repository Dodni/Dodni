- ðŸ¤µ I've worked as a waiter in France and in Hungary. After it, I've worked as a security guard, during school.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Information Technology Engineering at John Von Neumann University in KecskemÃ©t, Hungary. And now, I work during school as a production management assistant and I teach mathematics next to work.
